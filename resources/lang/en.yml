    stepTwoDescription: "The painter draws several variants of future jewel as a sketch according to your desire, whereupon we hand over the item you liked to the jeweller. Or if you have a clear idea of what you want to get finally, the jeweler will create 3D-model of the item according to your description or a photo. Thanks to such approach you will imagine a detailed picture of the final result and will have an opportunity to amend the model if necessary."
